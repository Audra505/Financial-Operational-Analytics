# Financial & Operational Analytics
_End-to-End Analytics Project_

# Project Overview

This project simulates an end-to-end financial and operational analytics workflow for a large, global organization. It demonstrates how raw, imperfect transactional data can be cleaned, modeled in PostgreSQL using a star schema, and analyzed in Power BI to provide leadership with visibility into revenue, cost, and margin performance across regions and business units.

The project is designed to reflect real-world enterprise analytics practices, emphasizing data quality, scalable modeling, and executive-focused insights.
