# Financial & Operational Analytics
_End-to-End Analytics Project_

# Project Overview

This project simulates an **end-to-end financial and operational analytics workflow** for a large, global organization. It demonstrates how raw, imperfect transactional data can be cleaned, modeled in PostgreSQL using a star schema, and analyzed in Power BI to provide leadership with visibility into revenue, cost, and margin performance across regions and business units.

The project is designed to reflect real-world enterprise analytics practices, emphasizing data quality, scalable modeling, and executive-focused insights.

# Business Context

The organization operates across multiple countries and internal departments (e.g., Sales, Legal, Accounting, Engineering, and Operations). It tracks internal financial activity using transaction-level records rather than consumer sales data.

## Business Objective

Enable leadership-level decision-making by providing visibility into revenue, cost, and margin performance, with a focus on identifying:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- Where action may be needed

## Key Business Questions Answered

- How are revenue, cost, and margin performing overall?
- How is performance changing over time (YoY / MoM)?
- Which regions and business units are driving results?
- Where is margin under pressure, and what are the underlying drivers?

This project translates those leadership questions into a structured analytics solution.
